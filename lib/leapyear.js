// A leap year is a year that has 366 days. A normal year has 365 days.
// The following function determines if a given year is a leap year.
// The rules for working out whether a year is a leap year are as follows:
// - If the year is cleanly by 400 then it is a leap year (i.e. 0, 400, 800, etc).
// - If the year is cleanly by 100 then it is not a leap year (i.e. 100, 200, 300, 500, etc).
// - If the year is cleanly by 4 then it is a leap year (i.e. 4, 8, ..., 96, 104, etc).
// - Otherwise the year is not a leap year.
function isLeapYear(year) {
}

// This function returns an array containing the leap years between
// a given start and end date.
